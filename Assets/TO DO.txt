Enemies    
    - improve waves and performance issues


Player
    - weird display issues with missile at first


- Background is repeating weirdly





- inevitable random bugs

- clean push
- local file backup


--------------------------------------------------

May or may not add:


- Leaderboard?
    (add credits if so)
- Explosion powerup still way too strong
- Black hole audio?
- Piercing UI needs a better graphic?
- Better player firing sound?
- Restrict targeting angle to frontwards of player?
- On game end, have black screen have a circular transition (if player becomes black hole)?

- Further tweak distance/angle for turrets seeing mouse position?
