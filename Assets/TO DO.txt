Enemies    
    - improve waves and performance issues


- fix background scroll speed (if set to 0 on game end, sprite flips for some reason)

- fix Instances combined with scene reloading


Value tweaking:    
    - enemy spawn rate increase on kill 
    - tweak angle of when turrets should see mouse position?
    - at what point in ambience clip should it begin?
    - sound volumes of all audio
    



--------------------------------------------------

May or may not add this stuff.

- Leaderboard?
    (add credits if so)
- Black hole sounds?
- Piercing UI needs a better graphic?
- Better player firing sound?
- Restrict targeting angle to frontwards of player?
- On game end, have black screen have a circular transition (if player becomes black hole)?

--------------------------------------------------


- {remove player being black hole by default}
- lots and lots and lots of testing
- inevitable random bugs

- setup itch page
- clean push
- local file backup
- delete/add comments
