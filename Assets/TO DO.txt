Audio Sounds    
    - poof     


Enemies    
    - fix waves and performance issues

Powerups
    - black hole isn't telling game manager it's eaten all Enemies





Value tweaking:    
    - enemy spawn rate increase on kill
    - enemy kills needed for next y offset randomization between waves    
    - tweak angle of when turrets should see mouse position?
    - at what point in ambience clip should it begin?
    - black hole scoring formula
