Audio Sounds    
    - poof for when enemy does not explode
    - black hole sounds?


Enemies    
    - fix waves and performance issues




Value tweaking:    
    - enemy spawn rate increase on kill
    - tweak angle of when turrets should see mouse position?
    - at what point in ambience clip should it begin?
