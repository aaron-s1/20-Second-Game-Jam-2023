Enemies    
    - improve waves and performance issues




Value tweaking:
    - enemy spawn rate increase on kill     
    - at what point in ambience clip should it begin?




- lots and lots and lots of testing
- inevitable random bugs

- setup itch page
- clean push
- local file backup
- delete/add comments

--------------------------------------------------

May or may not add:


- Leaderboard?
    (add credits if so)
- Explosion powerup still way too strong
- Black hole audio?
- Piercing UI needs a better graphic?
- Better player firing sound?
- Restrict targeting angle to frontwards of player?
- On game end, have black screen have a circular transition (if player becomes black hole)?

- Further tweak distance/angle for turrets seeing mouse position?
